 Face detection using a webcam with Python


The system processes images captured by the webcam in real time, aiming to detect faces. Recognized faces are transmitted to the frontend via the backend and database, where user verification processes can be performed. As the project progresses, additional features such as user login will be integrated to provide a more comprehensive identity verification solution. This work serves as an example of how facial recognition technology can be effectively utilized in web-based applications.
